# Decision Maker
The Decision Maker is a simple Python program that helps users make decisions by randomly selecting one option from a list of choices provided by the user. It can be used for various decision-making scenarios, such as choosing a restaurant, picking a movie to watch, or deciding what to wear.

# How it Works
The user is prompted to enter the number of choices they have. The program validates that the input is a positive integer within a predefined maximum limit (default is 10).  

The user is then asked to enter each choice one by one.
Once all the choices are entered, the program randomly selects one choice as the result.
The result is displayed to the user.
The user can choose to refresh and get a new random result, or quit the program.

# How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Download or clone the Decision Maker program to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory where the program is located.
Run the program by executing the following command in the command prompt or terminal:
Copy code
python decision_maker.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the number of choices and the choices themselves.
The program will display a randomly selected choice as the result.
To refresh and get a new result, simply press Enter. To quit the program, enter 'q' when prompted.
